# Efficient Docker Builds with Multistage and Distroless Images

## Overview
In the realm of containerization, optimizing Docker images for size and security is crucial. This blog explores the synergy of Multistage Docker Builds and Distroless Images to achieve minimal, secure, and efficient Docker containers.

## What is a Multistage Docker Build?
A Multistage Docker Build allows you to use multiple `FROM` statements within a single Dockerfile. This feature enables the creation of smaller, more efficient images by using intermediate images during the build process, which are eventually discarded. Here are the key benefits:
- **Reduced Image Size:** By including only the final artifacts and excluding build tools and dependencies, the final image size is minimized.
- **Improved Security:** Smaller images have fewer components, reducing the attack surface.
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Each stage can be cached independently, potentially speeding up builds if intermediate stages haven't changed.

## What is a Distroless Container Image?
A Distroless Container Image is a minimal Docker image containing only the application and its runtime dependencies, without a full-fledged operating system or unnecessary tools and libraries. This approach results in smaller, more secure images that reduce the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities. Key features and benefits include:
- **Minimal Size:** Leading to faster pull and deploy times.
- **Enhanced Security:** Fewer components mean fewer potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** Fewer dependencies to manage and update.
- **Performance:** Reduced overhead leads to better performance.

## Combining Multistage Builds with Distroless Images
Combining Multistage Builds with Distroless Images allows us to create Docker images that are both small and secure. This blog provides a step-by-step example of how to achieve this.

### Step-by-Step Example
1. **Create an EC2 Instance:** First, create an EC2 instance (Ubuntu) with the instance type as t2.micro (free-tier).
2. **Install Docker:** Download and install Docker on the instance by following the instructions from Docker's official documentation.
3. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** Clone the GitHub repository containing a Golang application.
4. **Create a Dockerfile Without Multistage:** Navigate to the `dockerfile-without-multistage` folder and create a Dockerfile.
5. **Check the Image Size:** After building the Docker image, you'll notice that its size is quite large.
6. **Create a Dockerfile with Multistage and Distroless:** Navigate back to the root directory and create a new Dockerfile.
7. **Compare the Image Sizes:** After building the multistage Docker image, you'll see a significant reduction in size.

## Advantages of Distroless Images
- **Smaller Image Size:** Distroless images include only the application and its runtime dependencies, resulting in significantly smaller images.
- **Enhanced Security:** With fewer components, the attack surface is minimized, and there are fewer potential vulnerabilities.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** Fewer components to manage and update.
- **Improved Performance:** Reduced size and minimized bloat lead to better performance.
- **Consistency and Predictability:** Ensures a consistent runtime environment by including only the necessary components.

## Conclusion
Combining Multistage Builds with Distroless Images is a powerful approach to creating minimal, secure, and efficient Docker containers. By reducing image size and minimizing the attack surface, this method enhances both security and performance, making it ideal for production environments.
